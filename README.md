# Laptop Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict laptop prices using data on laptop specifications. We have cleaned and preprocessed the data and applied various regression models. This project is still under development, we plan to make an application in which, using one of the models, we will be able to make a prediction on a case outside the dataset.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
1. To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts laptop prices based on their specifications.
2. To gain hands-on experience in data cleaning, preprocessing, and model building in the field of data science and machine learning.

## Main Features
- Data Cleaning: The raw data was cleaned to remove missing values and outliers.
- Data Preprocessing: Feature engineering and preprocessing techniques were applied to prepare the data for modeling.
- Regression Models: We implemented the following regression models:
  - Polylinear Regression
  - Decision Trees Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - SVRegression
  - XGBoost

## Technologies Used
- Python: We used Python as the primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- scikit-learn (sklearn): scikit-learn library was used for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- pandas: pandas library was used for data manipulation and analysis.

## Installation Instructions
